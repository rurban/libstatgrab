1) HP-UX stability
   ==> disk_io_stats: malloc(dirent)

2) MacOS X disk_io, page and general stats
   ==> mach_port_self() like sg_get_sys_pagesize()
   ==> all to init_comp?

3) configure.ac - xpg\d vs. their funcs
   * ac_check_funcs ...

4) DragonflyBSD & NetBSD testing
   Dragonfly 3.4 - no network traffic showing
   Dragonfly 3.4 - no user list
   NetBSD - all ok?

5) FreeBSD memory stats; totals don't add up
   should we include cache in free memory?
   so: free=free+inactive+cache, used=total-free ?

6) define __NEED_SG_GET_SYS_PAGE_SIZE only when needed

7) review code and cleanup common uses of same code
   ==> see what can be moved to init_comp ...

8) OpenBSD 5.3 - process stats missing
   Failed to get process snapshot: sysctl failed (Invalid argument: CTL_KERN.KERN_PROC.KERN_PROC_ALL)

9) Should sg_destroy_globals be wrapped inside one of the thread-related
   #ifdefs in globals.c?
   Some testing should be done with threads disabled and warnings
   turned on to see what other things crop up.
   globals.c:447:1: warning: 'sg_destroy_globals' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

10) Update manual pages to reflect recent API changes.
