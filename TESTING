Testing notes:

Grab the latest tarball from here:

http://snapshots.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/libstatgrab-0.90-rc1.tar.gz

Although not required to build, run and test libstatgrab, it may be
useful for debugging to have log4cplus installed. It can be found
at the page below. Don't worry if you can't install it, we can use the
stderr logging if a problem occurs.

http://log4cplus.sourceforge.net/

Finally, to run saidar, the ncurses header files need to be available.
Depending on your OS you may need to add these - on Linux it might be
in an ncurses-dev package.

To test libstatgrab perform the following steps:

Extract and build:

./configure
make
make test

If all tests pass run statgrab and saidar (saidar is only available if
ncurses was available):

./src/statgrab/statgrab
./src/saidar/saidar

A brief inspection of the output is useful. Saidar is better for this
because everything is usually visible on one screen. Just check the
numbers look right.

If this all went well, it would be useful to do any of the following:

- test with another compiler. clang? gcc? commercial alternative?
- test a 32-bit build on a 64-bit machine, using -m32 or equivalent
- test on other operating systems and/or versions

Finally, report back to us all the successful test cases.

If you find problems we may need to dig further. A good starting point
is to send us the output from the tests that fail, along with the
config.log file, and logging output (compile with --enable-logging if
log4cplus wasn't available and it'll log to stderr). And of course,
let us know the operating system version and hardware type.

Thank you for testing.
